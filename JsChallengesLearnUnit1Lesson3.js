/* In your own words, describe how focusing on mastery of a skill is different than grading a skill. */

Mastery is the process of self improvement. There are many sports analogies such as a boxer practicing in the mirror. The saying is When the boxer knocks out the boxer in the mirror you'll win or in golf "We are always trying to repeat the perfect shot that got us addicted to the sport in the first place". In golf what usually gets a person addicted to the sport is when they first start, they will hit a shot and it will be perfect. The ball will fly in the air and have a beautiful arc and you will spend the rest of your days trying to repeat that experience. The shot is purely luck because you don't know why or how you did it. But you did. Mastery is that way. I've spent long periods chasing that feeling of standing on a tee box on a beautiful weekend day. Knowing I was in heaven and being in tune with my surroundings, there is a confidence that comes before every swing, that this should be the perfect shot. The funny thing comes when you hit the ball and it goes where you thought it would. Because you know you can do better you start to critique minor things like spin, the launch angle of the ball, is your toe pointed in the right direction, was your grip sufficient and countless other minor adjustments. You do this to build muscle and mental memories to take into the next shot, the next round, the 25th year you're going to play. This is Mastery in practice.
